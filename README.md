TODO: Advance R learning

# AdvancedR3:

TODO: This project is about using lipidomics data to learning
reproducible workflows

This project will use git to share code with collaborators

# Brief description of folder and file contents

TODO: As project evolves, add brief description of what is inside the
data, doc and R folders.

The following folders contain:

-   `data/`: contains lipidomics data in csv format
-   `doc/`: this file contains a draft quarto document
-   `R/`: this folder contains the functions needed for process the data

# Installing project R package dependencies

If dependencies have been managed by using
`usethis::use_package("packagename")` through the `DESCRIPTION` file,
installing dependencies is as easy as opening the `AdvancedR3.Rproj`
file and running this command in the console:

    # install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_deps()

You'll need to have remotes installed for this to work.

# Resource

For more information on this folder and file workflow and setup, check
out the [prodigenr](https://rostools.github.io/prodigenr) online
documentation.
